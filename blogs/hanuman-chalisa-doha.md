 # Verse: "श्री गुरु चरण सरोज रज, निज मन मुकुरु सुधारि" 
 
 ## English Translation: "Taking the dust of Guru's lotus feet, I clean the mirror of my mind"      

 ## Psychological Interpretation: "Clarity begins when we wipe the dust off our inner mirror — the ego, the noise, the rush — and see ourselves with honesty and compassion."*    
 
Shri Tulsidas opens the Hanuman Chalisa with a reverent acknowledgment of the Guru. The term Guru here carries two intertwined meanings. On one level, it refers to Hanuman Ji himself — the eternal source of divine wisdom and devotion. On another, it points to the one who embodies Shri, the Divine Feminine principle represented by Sita Ji, whom Hanuman Ji regarded as his own Guru. In this way, Tulsidas Ji’s invocation can be understood as a prayer for grace from either Shri-Guru (Hanuman Ji) or Shri (the Divine Feminine seated upon the lotus).  
 
The imagery of dust and mirror offers profound symbolism. Just as a mirror covered with dust cannot reflect clearly, a mind clouded by ego and ignorance cannot receive wisdom. The dust of the Guru’s lotus feet represents the transforming power of humility and devotion — a sacred cleansing that prepares the seeker’s heart to absorb the spiritual light contained in the verses that follow.
