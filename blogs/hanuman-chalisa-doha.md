 Verse: "श्रीगुरु चरन सरोज रज"
 English Translation: "Taking the dust of Guru's lotus feet"
 
Shri Tulsidas begins the Hanuman Chalisa by offering gratitude to the Guru. The term Guru here holds two layers of meaning. First, it may refer to Shri as the Supreme Guru — the divine source of wisdom. Second, it may point to one who has Shri as their Guru, where Sita Ji embodies Shri herself. 

Hanuman Ji revered Sita Ji as his Guru, and thus the verse can be seen as invoking blessings from either Shri-Guru (Hanuman Ji) or Shri herself, seated upon the lotus. The imagery of dust and mirror is powerful — just as a dusty mirror cannot reflect clearly, our clouded minds cannot receive wisdom without guidance. Remembering and surrendering to the Guru purifies our inner self, making us receptive to higher truth and deeper clarity.
