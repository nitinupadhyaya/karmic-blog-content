 In Hindu tradition, while mantras do not contain the name of the rishi, the hymns in the Vedas are associated with the sages who received and revealed them. These sages, or rishis, are considered mantra-drashta (seers of the mantras), not the creators (mantra-karta), since the knowledge of the Vedas is believed to be eternal and revealed to them through deep meditation. 
The association between a hymn (sukta) and its rishi is formally listed in the Anukramani (indices) of the Vedas. When reciting a mantra or hymn from the Vedas, the rishi, meter (chandas), and deity (devata) are traditionally invoked first. 
Examples from the Rigveda
Gayatri Mantra (Rigveda 3.62.10): This is one of the most famous examples. The rishi associated with the Gayatri Mantra is Vishwamitra, who is also credited with revealing most of Mandala 3 of the Rigveda.
Atri Mandala (Rigveda, Mandala 5): The fifth book (mandala) of the Rigveda is named the Atri Mandala because its hymns were revealed to the Rishi Atri and his descendants.
Other prominent rishis: The Rigveda contains hymns revealed to many other prominent rishis, including:
Vashistha: Composed hymns dedicated to deities like Agni and Indra.
Bharadvaja: One of the seven great sages (saptarishis) who revealed many hymns.
Gotama: Another ancient Vedic rishi associated with hymns in the Rigveda. 
The tradition in practice
The practice of invoking the rishi before reciting a mantra is a sign of reverence for the sage who revealed the divine knowledge. For example, before beginning the recitation of the Vishnu Sahasranama, a declaration is made: Sri Veda Vyaso Bhagavan Rishi..., indicating that Veda Vyasa is the rishi of this particular verse. This practice is found throughout Vedic and post-Vedic literature.
