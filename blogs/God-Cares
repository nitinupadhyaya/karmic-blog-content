# Verse: "अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते ।
          तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ॥" 
 
 ## English Translation: "To those who are ever steadfast, who worship Me with single-minded devotion,
I carry what they lack and preserve what they have." -- By Swami Chinmayananda      

 ## Psychological Interpretation  

In this verse, Lord Krishna assures that for those who dedicate themselves wholly to the Divine — without distraction or duality of mind — He personally takes responsibility for their well-being.
The words “yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmyaham” are especially profound:  
*Yoga* means the attainment of what one lacks.
*Kṣema* means the preservation of what one has.

So, the Lord says, “I take care of both — acquiring what they need and protecting what they possess.”
